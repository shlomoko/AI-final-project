  Gnonograms-java Installation (from gnonograms-java.jar)
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Requires OpenJDK Java >=6 Runtime or equivalent .

  In the instructions below replace "x.x.x" by the version number of the program.

  Mark the file Gnonograms-x.x.x.jar as executable if the OS requires it.

  The program can then be run by right-clicking the .jar file and choosing "Open with OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime" or the equivalent command or by double-clicking.  This may not work on some systems if the file associations are not properly set. 

  Alternatively open a terminal/Command window in the directory containing the .jar file and enter 
  
  Linux: "java -jar ./Gnonograms-x.x.x.jar".
  Windows "javaw -jar ./Gnonograms-x.x.x.jar".
  
  NOTE: This program has mainly been tested on Linux. It is confirmed to run on Windows 7 but has not been tested on other versions of Windows or on Apple computers.  However, as it uses only standard Java it should run on any machine with a suitable Java Runtime Engine.

INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE ARCHIVE

Extract the compressed source 
Open terminal in the root directory (containing the Makefile)
Enter "make jar"
Proceed as above for installation from .jar

Alternatively, to launch the program directly from the compiled code:
